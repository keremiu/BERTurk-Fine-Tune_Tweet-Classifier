test_tweets_csv_path: C:\Users\kerem\OneDrive\BERT\BERTurk-Fine-Tune_Tweet-Classifier\Balanced.csv #test_tweets.csv             # A seperate test dataset that will be used by the Trainer class' test() method

# Dataset:
# The dataset must have the two columns of "text" and "label" in which the "text" column contains the tweets and "label" column contains the label(s)
# Both "text" and "label" columns must hold the string data type
# If an entry has multiple labels, then the labels in the "label" column should be seperated with a comma (,)
# A label cannot have blank spaces ( ), quotation marks ('' or "") and brackets ({} or []) in its name.
